## The libraries used 

import numpy as np

## The motivation for the project 

I have since childhood loved watching football and used to play at-least 2 hours everyday. I always wanted to analyze the what drives success of a club. Cost of acquiring and retaining a star player is a major cost associated in managing a football clubs. Fans and viewers associate themselves with a club because their star players belong to their club.

The objective of the analysis is to find if expensive players make better teams?

# The files in the repository with a small description of each
Football Analytics.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the codes and analysis
data.csv: Raw data for the analysis

# A summary of the results of the analysis
The key questinos answered are as follows: -

Q1: Which clubs spend the maximum $ per player?
Real Madrid, FC Barcalona spend the maximum $ payer

Q2: What is the relationship between age and performance?
Performance increases till a certain age and then starts detoriating. For few older players, we see higher performance as well.

Q3. What are the parameters driving the potential of a player?
The key parameters driving potential are Ball control, reaction and age.

The codes and datasets are attached with this blog post. The entire post can be found in the blog (https://medium.com/@mkjabc/does-expensive-players-make-better-teams-7de6d6d06958)
